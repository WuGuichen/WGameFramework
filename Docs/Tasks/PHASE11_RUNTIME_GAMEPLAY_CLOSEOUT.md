## Goal

Close Phase 11 Runtime Gameplay Foundation now that M1-M5 are implemented, by verifying the public API, docs, tests, dependency boundaries, and remaining risks.

This is a closeout and governance task. It should not add new gameplay features.

## Scope

### Do

- Review Phase 11 M1-M5 docs and current code:
  - Gameplay Runtime API;
  - Config Driven Ability;
  - Gameplay Diagnostic Snapshot;
  - Runtime Config Change Handling;
  - Ability Authoring Contract.
- Confirm `Docs/USAGE.md`, `Docs/Interfaces/Gameplay.md`, `Docs/CAPABILITIES.md`, and `Docs/README.md` tell the same story.
- Add a closeout section to `PHASE11_RUNTIME_GAMEPLAY_GOAL.md` or this task document with:
  - accepted public API list;
  - test evidence;
  - dependency boundary evidence;
  - known follow-up tasks;
  - explicit statement that WGame real data is not imported.
- If tests reveal missing documentation only, update docs. If tests reveal behavior bugs, stop and open a separate implementation task instead of fixing unrelated runtime behavior here.

### Do Not

- Do not implement new Ability effects, cooldown, cost, cast time, projectiles, physics, navigation, or animation.
- Do not start Ability visual editor work.
- Do not import WGame real Ability JSON.
- Do not touch Combat, Preview Runtime, or Phase 12 UI unless documenting dependency status.

## Expected Files

Allowed write scope:

```text
Docs/Tasks/PHASE11_RUNTIME_GAMEPLAY_CLOSEOUT.md
Docs/Tasks/PHASE11_RUNTIME_GAMEPLAY_GOAL.md
Docs/README.md
Docs/CAPABILITIES.md
Docs/USAGE.md
Docs/Interfaces/Gameplay.md
```

## Acceptance

- Phase 11 can be marked `Accepted / Closed` or has a precise reason why it must remain Active.
- M1-M5 completion evidence is summarized in one place.
- Runtime boundaries are explicitly checked: no WGame business types, no Unity Editor dependency required to understand runtime structure.
- Follow-up work is separated from closeout, not mixed into Phase 11.

## Closeout Result 2026-05-09

Phase 11 Runtime Gameplay Foundation is accepted and closed. M1-M5 are implemented, documented, and covered by the current Ability / Config EditMode suite. This closeout did not add gameplay features and did not import WGame real data.

### Accepted Public API

Gameplay runtime core:

- `IRuntimeEntity`
- `RuntimeEntity`
- `IAbility`
- `AbilityContext`
- `AbilityCastResult`
- `ITargetSelector`
- `IAbilityEffect`
- `AbilityEvent`
- `AbilityEventType`
- `SimpleAbility`
- `SelfTargetSelector`
- `SingleEnemyTargetSelector`
- `DamageEffect`
- `ApplyBuffEffect`
- `GameplayDiagnosticSnapshot`
- `GameplayDiagnosticSnapshotBuilder`

Config-driven ability and authoring bridge:

- `BasicAbilityConfig`
- `AbilityTargetSelectorKind`
- `AbilityEffectKind`
- `AbilityEffectConfig`
- `AbilityEffectParameters`
- `ConfigAbilityFactory`
- `RuntimeAbilityConfigResolver`
- `RuntimeConfigChangeSummary`
- `AbilityAuthoringContract`
- `AbilityAuthoringEffectContract`
- `AbilityAuthoringTargetSelectorKind`
- `AbilityAuthoringEffectKind`
- `AbilityAuthoringContractValidator`
- `AbilityAuthoringContractMapper`
- `AbilityAuthoringValidationCode`
- `AbilityAuthoringValidationIssue`
- `AbilityAuthoringValidationReport`
- `AbilityAuthoringSchema`
- `AbilityAuthoringSchemaSummary`

### M1-M5 Evidence

| Milestone | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 Gameplay Runtime API | Accepted | `MxFramework.Gameplay` exposes entity, ability, target selector, effect, cast result, and ability event API; `AbilitySliceTests` covers selector, damage, buff, event order, failure, tick, and alive semantics. |
| M2 Config Driven Ability | Accepted | `BasicAbilityConfig -> ConfigAbilityFactory -> SimpleAbility` is documented in `Docs/USAGE.md` and `Docs/Interfaces/Gameplay.md`; `ConfigAbilityFactoryTests` covers damage, buff, errors, named parameters, legacy parameters, references, event order, and hardcoded parity. |
| M3 Runtime Snapshot / Diagnostics | Accepted | `GameplayDiagnosticSnapshotBuilder.Build(...)` is documented; `GameplayDiagnosticSnapshotTests` covers entity, attribute, buff, modifier, ability, event, failure, copy, and empty-state snapshots. |
| M4 Runtime Config Change Handling | Accepted | `RuntimeAbilityConfigResolver` uses rebuild-on-resolve semantics; `RuntimeConfigChangeHandlingTests` covers no hot-swap, no retroactive Buff / Modifier mutation, summary fields, and policy-aware failures. |
| M5 Ability Authoring Contract | Accepted | `AbilityAuthoringContract` / validator / mapper / schema summary are documented; `AbilityAuthoringContractTests` covers mapping, stable error codes, schema summary, and config factory integration. |

### Verification Evidence

- `dotnet build WGameFramework.sln --no-restore -v minimal`: passed, 0 errors, 10 existing warnings.
- Unity EditMode via MCP, assembly `MxFramework.Tests`, filters `MxFramework.Tests.Ability` and `MxFramework.Tests.Config`: passed, 124 total, 124 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Unity Console via MCP, errors only: 0 entries.
- `Tools/GitNexus/gitnexus.sh detect-changes`: passed; 43 files, 130 symbols, affected processes 0, risk level low.

### Dependency Boundary Evidence

- `Assets/Scripts/MxFramework/Gameplay/MxFramework.Gameplay.asmdef` has `noEngineReferences=true` and references only `MxFramework.Core`, `MxFramework.Events`, `MxFramework.Attributes`, `MxFramework.Buffs`, and `MxFramework.Modifiers`.
- `Assets/Scripts/MxFramework/Config.Runtime/MxFramework.Config.Runtime.asmdef` has `noEngineReferences=true` and references runtime modules only, including `MxFramework.Gameplay`.
- Text search over `Gameplay` and `Config.Runtime` found no runtime dependency on `UnityEngine`, `UnityEditor`, WGame namespaces, Entitas, or Luban. Unity references found during closeout are limited to tests, Demo, UI Toolkit, or comments describing that runtime code does not depend on Unity.
- `Docs/USAGE.md`, `Docs/Interfaces/Gameplay.md`, `Docs/CAPABILITIES.md`, and `Docs/README.md` now describe the same Phase 11 surface and status.

### Known Follow-Up Tasks

- Runtime Preview 03.5 remains separate from Phase 11. Its 03.5B / 03.5C / 03.5E follow-up lanes were completed in the parallel dispatch batch after this closeout.
- Phase 12 UI Toolkit work continues separately; UI polish and reusable controls must not change Phase 11 runtime contracts without a new task.
- WGame Ability JSON mapping, richer target rules, cooldown, cost, cast time, projectile, physics, navigation, animation, formula DSL, and production Ability visual editor work remain outside Phase 11.
- Snapshot JSON serialization, save/replay semantics, and Runtime Preview protocol mapping remain future tasks rather than Phase 11 acceptance requirements.

### Explicit Non-Import Statement

No WGame real Ability JSON, concrete WGame character data, concrete WGame Buff payloads, Entitas runtime, or Luban generated data were imported into Phase 11.

## Suggested Verification

```text
dotnet build WGameFramework.sln --no-restore -v minimal
Unity EditMode: MxFramework.Tests.Ability
Unity EditMode: MxFramework.Tests.Config
Unity Console: 0 compile error
Tools/GitNexus/gitnexus.sh detect-changes
```

## Dispatch Notes

You are not alone in the codebase. Treat this as a documentation and verification task. Do not revert unrelated local changes or implement new runtime behavior.
